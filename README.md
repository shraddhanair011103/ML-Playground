## About This Repo

In this repository, you'll find implementations of classical machine learning algorithms such as:

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes


Each algorithm is implemented from the ground up without using any ML libraries, to help deepen understanding of the fundamentals.
